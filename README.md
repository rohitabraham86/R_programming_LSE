Practical Activity 4.1.9 Creating and querying a data frame

Scenario
Miss Louw is so excited about your proposal on how to keep track of stock for Bennieâ€™s Books, that she has decided to create a loyalty programme for repeat customers.
She has provided you with raw data that indicates the personal information of clients (bennies_books_loyalty_data.txt). 
Miss Louw wants you to create a unique customer ID for each customer on the list, along with adding it to the table and extracting the data from the table.
This will include:

-all female customers
-all customers over the age of 50
-all customers with fewer than 20 purchases.

Objective
Create a data frame in R containing the information that Miss Louw provided, and then use functions to extract data from the table.
